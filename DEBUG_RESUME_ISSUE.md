**üîß DEBUG STEPS TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUE:**

## **Current Issue Analysis:**
The N8N webhook is receiving empty `resume_id`, which means either:
1. The resume record isn't being created properly
2. The resume data isn't being passed correctly to `triggerResumeParser`
3. The database migration hasn't been run (missing columns)

---

## **Step 1: Run Database Migration First**
**CRITICAL:** Run this in Supabase SQL Editor before testing:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of:
-- supabase/add-missing-columns.sql
```

This ensures all required database columns exist.

---

## **Step 2: Test Resume Upload**
1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Upload a resume file**
4. **Look for these logs:**

```
=== STARTING RESUME PARSER ===
Input parameters: { resumeId: "uuid-here", fileUrl: "http://...", userId: "mock-user-id" }
N8N Configuration check: { ... }
=== SENDING TO N8N ===
```

---

## **Step 3: Check What's Being Sent**
If you see this error in console:
- `ERROR: Resume ID is empty or undefined` ‚Üí Database issue
- `ERROR: File URL is empty or undefined` ‚Üí Upload issue
- `N8N not properly configured` ‚Üí Configuration issue

---

## **Step 4: Temporary Fix for Testing**
If N8N auth is causing issues, I've updated the code to:
- ‚úÖ Skip auth token when not properly configured
- ‚úÖ Add detailed logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Validate all parameters before sending

---

## **Next Steps:**
1. **Run the database migration**
2. **Test resume upload**
3. **Check console logs**
4. **Share the exact logs** you see in browser console

This will help identify exactly where the `resume_id` is getting lost! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
