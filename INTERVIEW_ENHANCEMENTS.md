   - Follow-up: "What strategies do you use to prioritize tasks under pressure?"

## Database Storage Schema

### interview_questions table
- Stores both main questions and follow-ups
- Sub-numbering system for follow-ups (e.g., 1.1, 1.2)
- Links to mock_interviews via mock_interview_id

### interview_responses table
- Stores all candidate responses
- Links to specific questions via question_id
- Timestamps for response tracking

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Database Connectivity
1. Navigate to Interview World page
2. Click "üóÑÔ∏è Test Database Connection" button
3. Check console and toast notifications for results
4. Verify all tables (mock_interviews, interview_questions, interview_responses) are accessible

### 2. Test Follow-up Question Flow
1. Start a new interview (any company/role combination)
2. Answer the first question: "Tell me about yourself and why you're interested in this role."
3. Click "Next Question" 
4. Verify you see the first follow-up question
5. Answer the follow-up and click "Next Question"
6. Verify you see the second follow-up question
7. Continue through the flow to test main question ‚Üí follow-ups ‚Üí next main question

### 3. Test Database Storage
1. Complete a full interview including follow-ups
2. Check browser console for database save logs
3. Look for messages like:
   - "[Database] Successfully saved main response for question: [question text]"
   - "[Database] Successfully saved follow-up response"
   - "[Database] All responses saved successfully"

### 4. Verify Interview Progression
1. Ensure question count is not displayed to candidate
2. Verify only one transcript display (no duplicates)
3. Test that Next Question button is disabled until response is provided
4. Confirm interview completion message appears after final question

## Key Features

### Interview Flow Logic
- `currentQuestionIndex`: Tracks main question position
- `currentSubQuestion`: Tracks follow-up position (0 = main question, 1+ = follow-ups)
- Smart progression logic handles transitions between main and follow-up questions

### Response Storage
```typescript
interface QuestionResponse {
  questionId: string;
  question: string;
  answer: string;
  followUpResponses: Array<{
    question: string;
    answer: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }>;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

### Database Operations
- Comprehensive `saveInterviewResponses` function
- Handles both main questions and follow-ups
- Creates proper question records with sub-numbering
- Saves all responses with timestamps
- Full error handling and logging

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Manual Testing**: Use the enhanced interface to complete full interviews
2. **Database Verification**: Check Supabase dashboard to verify data storage
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with different question counts and follow-up scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify smooth transitions and responsive UI

The interview system now provides a professional candidate experience with comprehensive data storage and proper follow-up question handling.
