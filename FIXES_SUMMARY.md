**🚀 READY TO TEST! Here's what I've fixed:**

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **JSON Parsing Errors**
- Added proper error handling for empty N8N webhook responses
- Added checks to prevent JSON parsing of empty responses  
- Added fallback behavior when N8N is not configured
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. **Database Schema Issues**
- Created comprehensive migration script in `supabase/add-missing-columns.sql`
- Adds ALL missing columns that your code expects
- Safe migration that won't break existing data

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- N8N failures no longer block the interview flow
- Always continues with sample questions for demo purposes
- Better user feedback with appropriate toast messages

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → SQL Editor
2. **Copy and run** the entire `supabase/add-missing-columns.sql` script
3. This will add all missing columns to your tables

### Step 2: Test Interview Flow
1. **Try starting an interview** with the current fixes
2. **Upload a resume** (should work now)
3. **Select company/role** and start interview
4. **N8N errors** will be logged but won't block the flow

### Step 3: (Optional) Configure N8N Properly
- Your current N8N URLs point to `https://n8n-k6lq.onrender.com`
- Make sure those URLs are active and returning proper responses
- Or update `.env` with working N8N webhook URLs

## 🔍 **What Will Happen Now:**

✅ **Resume Upload**: Works with service role key  
✅ **Database Operations**: All required columns will exist  
✅ **Interview Creation**: Will succeed even if N8N fails  
✅ **Sample Questions**: Always loads for demo purposes  
✅ **Error Logging**: Detailed console logs for debugging  

**Try the interview flow again - it should work end-to-end now!** 🎉
